# Spoti_screen

Simple project to display the current song played and artist on a small screen to not have to look
on a phone or open the Spotify app.

It will probably use the spotipy package & a rasperypi pico with a eInk screen as interface.
It could also be awersome to have button to skip, pause, play and a volume wheel, but it will
heavily depends on available hardware, price, and my motivation.
